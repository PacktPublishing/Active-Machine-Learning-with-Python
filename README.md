**Refine and elevate data quality over quantity with active learning**

## What is this book about?

Building accurate machine learning models requires quality data—lots of it. However, for most teams, assembling massive datasets is time-consuming, expensive, or downright impossible. Led by Margaux Masson-Forsythe, a seasoned ML engineer and advocate for surgical data science and climate AI advancements, this hands-on guide to active machine learning demonstrates how to train robust models with just a fraction of the data using Python's powerful active learning tools.


This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Master the fundamentals of active machine learning
* Understand query strategies for optimal model training with minimal data
* Tackle class imbalance, concept drift, and other data challenges
* Evaluate and analyze active learning model performance
* Integrate active learning libraries into workflows effectively
* Optimize workflows for human labelers
* Explore the finest active learning tools available today

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
y_true = np.array(small_dataset['label'])
x_true = np.array(small_dataset['text'])
```
**Following is what you need for this book:**
Ideal for data scientists and ML engineers aiming to maximize model performance while minimizing costly data labeling, this book is your guide to optimizing ML workflows and prioritizing quality over quantity. Whether you’re a technical practitioner or team lead, you’ll benefit from the proven methods presented in this book to slash data requirements and iterate faster.
Basic Python proficiency and familiarity with machine learning concepts such as datasets and convolutional neural networks is all you need to get started.
